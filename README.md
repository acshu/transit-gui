transit-gui
===========
transit-gui allows rapid and interactive calculation of synthetic planet transits.  Its algorithm is based on the solution of the direct problem of planet transits by transformation of double integrals to single ones (Kjurkchieva, Dimitrov, Vladev, Yotov, 2013, MNRAS, in press).

Requirements
------------
The code requires latest versions of [Python 2.x](http://python.org), [Scipy](http://scipy.org), [PyQT](http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro) and [transit-lib](https://github.com/acshu/transit-lib).

For Windows users we recommend [Python(x,y)](https://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/) which includes latest python version along with commonly used scientific packages packed in a user-friendly installation.


Prebuild version
----------------
You can also download prebuid Windows version of the transit-gui [here](http://astro.shu-bg.net/software/tac-maker/).
